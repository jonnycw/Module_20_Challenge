# Smart Contract Joint Savings Account

## Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the creation of joint savings accounts by writing a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses that control the joint savings account.

## Technology

The code was written using Solidity version 0.5.0 in Remix IDE.

1. Use the setAccounts function to define the authorized Ethereum address that will be able to withdraw funds from your contract.

2. Test the deposit functionality of your smart contract by sending the following amounts of ether: 2 ETH, 3 ETh, 4 ETH

Send 2 ETH
